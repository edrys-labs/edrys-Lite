# edrys-Lite: Revolutionizing Remote Laboratories


Welcome to edrys-Lite, the cutting-edge open-source project designed to revolutionize how we create and share remote laboratories. In a world where education and research are increasingly moving online, edrys-Lite provides an intuitive and simplistic way for users to engage with laboratory environments directly from their browser -- no servers required.




## Introduction

- Project name and a brief, compelling overview
- Vision statement or inspirational quote that reflects the ethos of the project


Inspired by @edrysorg, which is unfortunately not under active development, edrys-Lite aims to provide a serverless peer-to-peer approach for remote laboratories. By leveraging the latest web technologies, such as WebRTC for real-time, peer-to-peer connections, and CRDTs for collistion free state handling, edrys-Lite offers a seamless, serverless experience for users worldwide.

Whether you're a student, educator, researcher, or enthusiast, edrys-Lite invites you to explore, contribute, and grow with us. Together, we can unlock new realms of possibility and innovation in the digital age.
